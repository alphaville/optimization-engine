//! An optimization problem
//!
//! This struct defines an optimization problem in terms of its cost function
//! (cost function and its gradient) and constraints
//!
//! Cost functions are user defined. They can either be defined in Rust or in
//! C (and then invoked from Rust via an interface such as icasadi).

/// The definition of an optimisation problem involves:

/// - the cost function
/// - the set of constraints, which is described by implementations of
///   [Constraint](../../panoc_rs/constraints/trait.Constraint.html)
